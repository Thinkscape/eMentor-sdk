# "order" model #

Introduction
==============

An `order` object refers to a single order placed by a client. Store "carts" ("baskets") are implemented as temporary
orders (with status `CART`). Each client can have multiple concurrent orders and each `order` can have multiple
`OrderItems` (docs can be [found here](orderitem.md)).

Associations
==============

### /item

 * **model**: [OrderItem](orderitem.md)
 * **count**: 0 or more
 * **access**: write+read

This association holds all order items - each item represents one unique product.

For example, to retrieve all items for order `2011-05-DXD9` we could use the following REST request:

    GET /api/v2/rest/order/2011-05-DXD9/item

To add new item to this order:

    POST /api/v2/rest/order/2011-05-DXD9/item
    Content-Type: text/json

    {productId:"dKKDO28x"}

### /user

 * **model**: [user](user.md)
 * **count**: 1
 * **access**: read-only

This association holds the user (owner) of this order.

For example, to retrieve owner of order `2011-05-DXD9` we could use the following REST request:

    GET /api/v2/rest/order/2011-05-DXD9/user
